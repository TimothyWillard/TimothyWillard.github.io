[Version 3.2 of `pyinfra` was released today!](https://github.com/pyinfra-dev/pyinfra/releases/tag/v3.2) It includes lots of good things that I'm excited about including fixes to crontab deployments, new pipx operations and facts, the ability to pass data via `local.include` (contributed by me), and much more! Documentation on my contribution can be found [here](https://docs.pyinfra.com/en/3.x/using-operations.html#include-multiple-files).
